# Insurance-system
This project is for Cars insurance system management. 
In this application the major challenge is to send SMS automatically to customers to inform them a few days in advance of the expiry date of their insurance contracts.
To do this, we therefore use the BackgroundScheduler of python. 
We also have the Twilio API which is a web application programming interface (API) that software developers can use to add communications such as phone calling, 
messaging, video and two-factor authentication into their Python applications.
